# Things I've learned during the 1st week

For the first time I took the time learning how to setup a domain on Github for building a website.
I could've used the domain they provide with my account's IP address `arthurkaminsky.github.io`,
but I wanted to use my custom domain that I bought for my blogging site.

I came across the instructions provided [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
for setting up my custom domain so that I could redirect my domain to Github since I want Github to host my website.

I did everything needed to be done based on the guide, yet for some reason I stumbled sometimes with configuring the custom domain due to creating an invalid CNAME.
Long story short, I think I managed to fix this, I just need to wait 24 hours and see what happens next.

I have the following links for the guide:
