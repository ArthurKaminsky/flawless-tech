# flawless-tech
---------------------------

Here I'll be writing my templates for tech articles that I'll be publishing (mostly on [Medium](https://medium.com/@arthurkaminsky)).

This is my playground for testing various possibilities of explorations with markdown syntax and helping myself write better documentations for having other tech nerds other than myself to explore from mundane terminal commands to exhilarating code writing.

I'll be writing here frequently when I find new ideas for articles to write and if anyone stumbles across this repository, I would sincerely appreciate if you'd bring new ideas or topics to write about for helping other programmers to learn in a more enjoyable and less tedious manner.
